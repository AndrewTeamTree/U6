# Static Node.js and Express Site
Node.js and Express make a powerful pair when used together on the server side, and are used everyday to make fast, modular and dynamic web applications. In this project, I use Node.js, Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site to show off the projects I've built. No link is provided to view, because it is built using the Back-End code, it cannot be displayed on github pages unless its built using just Front-End code.
